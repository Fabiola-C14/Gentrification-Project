# Gentrification-Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify cities in Los Angeles county that are going or will be going through gentrification. We believe gentrified neighborhoods have the following characteristics:

* Below average income
* Increase in coffee shops (Starbucks)
* Increase in property value
* Increase in yoga studios
* Decrease in crime rate

## Scope

The following questions were posed to help us determine which specific cities were gentrified in Los Angeles County:

* What is the average income in the targeted?
* What is the average income in the targeted neighborhoods?
* What is the average property/home value in each city?
* What is the distribution of Starbucks in each city?
* What is the number of yoga studios in each city?
* What is the trend during gentrification period?
* Which of these variables highly correlated? (casual relationship)

## Data Sources

* Census.gov
* Zillow
* Starbucks website
* Yelp API
* lacounty.gov
* data.lacity.org

## Summary of Findings

* Cities with a higher income population seems to cluster around the beach areas, and low income population is clustered near downtown LA/110 freeway.
* Starbucks locations are a milestone of gentrification, as they show up only in middle income areas. 
* Yoga studio count based on postal code should not be considered an indicator for potential gentrification. It does however strongly correlate to higher income neighborhoods. 
* Zip codes most suitable for abnormal housing price changes are Van Nuys, North Hill##s, and Baldwin Hills
Baldwin Hills has a higher crime rate, leaving Van Nuys and North Hills as most likely to be gentrified.
