# Gentrification-Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify cities in Los Angeles county that are going or will be going through gentrification. We believe gentrified neighborhoods have the following characteristics:

* Below average income
* Increase in coffee shops (Starbucks)
* Increase in property value
* Increase in yoga studios
* Decrease in crime rate

## Questions

The following questions were posed to help us determine which specific cities were gentrified in Los Angeles County:

* What is the average income in the targeted neighborhoods?
* What is the average property/home value in each city?
* What is the distribution of Starbucks in each city?
* What is the number of yoga studios in each city?
* What is the trend during gentrification period?
* Which of these variables highly correlated? (casual relationship)
